- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change the directory to the "Backend" folder:
     ```

     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install the required packages for the backend server:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure MongoDB**:
   - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.
  

4. **Run the Server**:
   - Start the backend server by running the following command:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - The server should now be running at http://localhost:8000.
   - You should see a message in the terminal indicating that the server is running.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Authentication Directory**:
   - Open another terminal or command prompt (keep the backend terminal running).

     npm install
     ```



3. **Run the Frontend Application**:
   - Start the React development server by running the following command:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
   - Your default web browser will open automatically with the application.

## Usage

- Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend React application.
- The application provides authentication features like sign up, login, and logout using the backend server's API.
- You can interact with the frontend application to register new users, log in with existing users, and log out.
