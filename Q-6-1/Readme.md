# Palindrome Checker

This is a Python script that checks whether a given word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` script is located.

   ```
     python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter a Word**:

- After running the script, you will be prompted to enter a word.

  ```
    Enter a word: [Enter your word here]
  ```

3. **Check the Result**:

- The script will then check if the entered word is a palindrome.
- If the word is a palindrome, it will display the following message:

```
     The word '[Entered Word]' is a palindrome.
```

- If the word is not a palindrome, it will display the following message along with the reverse of the word:

```
     The word '[Entered Word]' is not a palindrome, the reverse is '[Reversed Word]'.
```
