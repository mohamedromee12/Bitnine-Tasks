# Finding the Missing Number in an Array

This is a JavaScript script that finds the missing number in an array of integers from 1 to 45. The script calculates the missing number by finding the difference between the sum of all numbers from 1 to 45 and the sum of the given array.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.js` script is located.

```
     node main.js
```

2. **Check the Result**:

- The script will calculate the missing number in the `arrayWithMissingNumber` array.
- It will then display the following message:

```
    The missing number is [Missing Number]
```
